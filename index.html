      <h1>The Tower of Deception</h1>
      <p>
         This is our story of struggle with Tower Insurance. We now understand that
         deceptions and denials are universal across many insurance companies here and abroad.
         We sincerely hope that this is not your story, and it never will be.
         We are sharing our story to help you make informed decisions about insurances
         and insurance companies.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
         A burst water pipe in the ceiling caused serious damage to a large portion of our house.
         The incident happened in November 2017, and the house is still uninhabitable.
         Both the insurance company and their two subcontractors (Asset Managers and
         Absolute Building Solutions) have been well below acceptable standards in the reinstatement work,
         and the house was left in a much worse condition than it was soon after the flooding incident.
         The subcontractors have damaged a number of the house content as well.
      </p>
      <p>
         There were three subcontractors involved: one to dry the house, and two for reinstatement work.
         JAE, who were there to dry the place, was professional. The insurance instructed JAE to
         leave before the house was completely dry: the house had a moisture content five times the
         acceptable limit when JAE was asked to leave. Insurance stated that the builder will open
         the walls to dry the house out, but after JAE left the insurance got the builders to
         plaster and paint the still-wet house. We discovered that the moisture level in the
         house was still deemed high in some parts as late as May 2018 and JAE was brought
         back in the second time to dry these areas. In the meanwhile, there are cracks
         and peels in the new paint. Work carried out in the bathrooms have been non-compliant
         (holes in the wall, water-proofing not applied correctly, incorrect GIB used) but the
         insurance reiterated compliance and high-quality workmanship until an independent building
         surveyor questioned these.
      </p>
      <p>
         The subcontractors (Asset Managers and Absolute Building Solutions) have damaged a large
         number of items: many of the internal doors have been chipped; walls have been incorrectly
         plastered/painted; the bath was not protected during work and has been covered in paint
         and plaster; the shower drain was filled with broken tiles and cement because it was
         left open; many of our personal content have been abused (for instance, toilet was
         placed on one bed, and toilet mats were placed on the other bed; our food processor
         was used to mix cement; a solid-wood bookshelf was used as a sawhorse and subsequently
         damaged).
      </p>
      <p>
         Tower, as one might expect, is unwilling to accept any liability. Their tales get stranger by the day!
         The sad part is that the damages Tower has caused can be fixed, it is just that Tower isn't willing
         to fix them.
      </p>
      <p>
         Even though Tower had not fulfilled their policy obligations, Tower decides not to renew our house
         insurance when it is up for renewal. The house is not habitable, and until then no other insurance
         company would insure it.
      </p>
      <p>
         Fighting an insurance company takes time. An awful amount of time. And Tower knows this, and
         the timeline below shows it.

                  JAE, drying company contracted by Tower, started the drying process in the morning.
                  They removed the carpet to help with the drying process
                  and discarded it with Tower's permission. (Months later Tower
                  is to deny that the carpet was ever removed, and refuse
                  the replacement cost.)

                  The drying process was stopped by Tower, stating that the drying was not effective
                  and their builders will remove the wall Gibs to expedite the drying process.
                  When JAE left the house the moisture level readings in the house were five times higher
                  than the accepted threshold values &ndash; something we understood later in the
                  piece. Moisture levels are to remain high for another five months to come.

                  Private plumbers start replacing old pipework. Tower was happy to have us do this work
                  before reinstatement commenced. The following day, the plumbers cut a few tiles in the
                  bathrooms, thereby damaging the water-proofing. This required water-proofing to be re-done
                  and the plumbers ask their insurance company to fix this.

                  Asset Managers, Tower's building contractor, commence reinstatement work in lieu of
                  the original water damage.
                  They do not open any walls. There was no moisture measurement taken before
                  this reinstatement work.

                  Keith McDonald, Tower's assessor, visits the house to assess the damage in bathrooms.
                  <br />
                  Asset Managers had damaged a number of doors during the reinstatement process, and
                  the plaster and paint work was substandard. In addition, they broke the key to the
                  main door, and then to have continued access to the house, they "broke" the garage
                  door mechanism so that it can be opened from outside, effectively leaving the house
                  unlocked when they were leaving for the day. Keith is shown all of this, and he
                  assures to bring this up with Asset Managers.

                  Asset Managers ask us to collect the house keys from their
                  office in East Tamaki.
                  When we go there, we are told that the keys are "securely stored"
                  on-site (i.e., at our house) with a combination lock.
                  Anton Tallot, the boss of Asset Managers, accompany us to the
                  site to unlock the combination and retrieve the key.
                  We then understand that there was no lock, no comination, the
                  keys were left under the flower pot, and were nowhere to be
                  found. The following day Anton texts to say that he will pay for
                  the replacement of all locks of the house as they have lost the set of keys.

                  The bathroom reinstatement work and water-proofing is seen
                  to be non-compliant. Besides, Tony had been using our personal
                  belonging during his work: he used our kitchen blender to mix
                  cement, and had been washing plaster and paint down the kitchen
                  sink. We write to Tower to remedy these.

                  is to a high standard and correctly installed. The waterproofing is applied

                  Tower's Keith Macdonald and Ross Hailday visits the property
                  with their building consultant to meet with Gary Chalk and us,
                  and resolve the issues.
                  <br />
                  A number of issues come to light from hereon. No moisture measurements
                  were taken before reinstatment work began. Gary points out the moisture
                  level in the house is still high &ndash; which explains why the new paint
                  is cracking and peeling off.
                  Water-proofing applied poorly. The bath should have been taken out before
                  water-proofing but it was not, and was damaged by spills and excess water-proofing.
                  Gaping holes were left in the wall, or taped over and water-proofed.
                  The Gibs were poorly screwed to the timber, and therefore not strong enough to hold
                  tiles.

                  Tower brings JAE in to do moisture measurements, and some areas of the house
                  are found to have moisture levels above acceptable limits (after all these months
                  with a hot summer in between). Foil-backed Gib does not let the moisture dry easily unless
                  opened up &ndash; something Gary pointed out to us. Asset Managers did not open any walls,
                  and did not bother checking moisture levels either.
                  <br />
                  JAE bring heaters and dries the places for nearly a week.

                  Tower is keen to bring their contractors back in to "fix", but given the
                  mess they created, we opt to go for a cash settlement so that we can bring
                  a reliable builder. Tower offers us $21,500.
                  We had two quotes and these
                  are around $80,000 for labour &ndash; with everything considered, the total
                  cost of getting the house back to how it was before the damages is around $149,000.
                  We point these out to Tower who update the scope of work, but not the cash sum

                  backing down from their previously proposed scope.
                  Their revised offer is $55,700. We note that their buider's quote is unrealisitic
                  especially for reinstating the two bathrooms. In addition, none of the material
                  costs and the carpet reinstatement costs are included. When we point this to their
                  solicitor, Tower chooses to ignore it. We reject the offer.

               <p>
                  Building Practioners Board arranges a hearing on Tony Gamble of Absolute Building Solutions.
                  Tony admits incorrect water-proofing and incorrect installtion of Gib walls.
                  The walls need to be stripped down, rebuilt, and new water-proofing applied.
                  The Board finds that these shortfalls are not serious enough to
                  impose a penalty on Tony.

            <p>
               A kitchen blender for mixing grout and cement? A licenced building practioner,
               Tony Gamble, couldn't have thought of a better idea. The only problem was that the blender
               is ours &mdash; not something Tony brought from his company.

            <h3>Paint and Cement down the Sink</h3>
            <p>
               When we told Tower to tell their contractors to stop using the kitchen sink to wash down
               paint and cement, this is what Tower's Keith McDonald had to tell us:
               "A painter's knife sitting on the bench does not constitute that the sink has been
               used for cleaning purposes."
               The contractors were working in the bathrooms and had no need to go to the kitchen.

            <p>
               Tony Gamble of Absolute Builders used our Rimu bookshelf as a sawhorse.
               Tower agreed to replace it initially, and when they figured out it is quite
               expensive they said they can only contribute 50% of the cost according to
               our contents policy &mdash; a policy we never had.

            "Insurance doesn't work when the insurance company fails to honor the terms of the policy
            and its promise of security through the strategy that has become known as <em>
               delay, deny,
               defend
            </em>. The company delays payment of a claim, denies all or part of a valid claim, or
            aggressively defends litigation the policyholder is forced to bring to get what
            he is rightfully owed. When insurance doesn't work, the consequences are more severe
            than when any other kind of company fails to keep its promise. If a homeowner hires
            someone to paint his house and the painter never shows up, the homeowner can take his
            money and hire someone else. If the insurance company refuses to pay a claim, it is too
            late to go elsewhere for another policy; no company will write a policy that will pay for
            fire damage that has already occurred."
